<h1>Where could a career in coding will take me?</h1>
<h2>So glad you asked, I'm going to tell you right now!</h2>

<!---Body--->

<br>
<p>I hope to work in Seattle at various startups for a few years and eventually be able to work remotely or freelance. My dream is to work most of the year while having the flexiblity to travel and climb all around the world.</p>
<br>
<p>I've always liked the simple idea of using a dinky little laptop and doing some radical coding work. Something about that seems so cool to me. Maybe get one of those sweet little personal hotspots, amirite?</p>
<br>
<p>But seriously, this is me when I remember I'm starting Galvanize soon:</p>
