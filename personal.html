<h2>Here's a little about me!</h2>

<!---Body--->

<br>
<p>I'm an avid rock climber and you can often find me at the Seattle Bouldering Project climbing gym. I've always loved using computers and I'm excited by new technologies. I also love craft IPAs, al pastor burritos and memes - all dank as possible, please!</p>
<br>
<p>I was born and raised here in Seattle, and am still discovering fun things to do in and around this city all the time. How lucky is that?</p>
<br>
<p>I greatly prefer cold weather to hot, take both cream and sugar in my coffee, and am undecided on the cat versus dog debate. How could you even choose? Furry things are so great.</p>
<br>
<p>If you can't already tell, I do a lot of climbing. Here's basically how I spend my freetime when I'm not coding:</p>

<p>And finally, who can say no to a kitten picture?</p>
